# React Interview Challenge

## Description

This exercise is to create a demo calendar application using React. It was created using custom hooks and context api to handle state management into the localStorage.

## Features applied

- I did apply the required features described in the Readme page of this application(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jobsity/ReactChallenge/main/README.md).
- Ability to add "_reminders_" (max. 30 characters) for a day and time specified by the user. Also, include a city.
- Ability to edit reminders - including changing text, city, day and time.
- Add a weather service call from [AccuWeather](https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-forecast-api/apis/get/forecasts/v1/daily/5day/%7BlocationKey%7D) and get the weather forecast (e.g. Rain) for the date of the calendar reminder based on the city. This shows the forecast only for the current day due to it be using free api account, is possible to see an image based on the weather forecast.

# How to deploy

- Run `npm install` | `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
- Run `npm start` | `yarn run` to run the app locally.
- You can find the project running on `localhost:3000`.
